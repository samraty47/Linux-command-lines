Tip


The file /etc/group contains all the groups defined in the system

You can use the command "groups" to find all the groups you are a member of

You can use the command “newgrp” to work as a member a group other than your default group
		newgrp Nepal
		cat > test
			This is test of creating new group.
		^ c
		ls -dl test 

You cannot have 2 groups owning the same file.

You do not have nested groups in Linux. One group cannot be sub-group of other

x- eXecuting a directory means Being allowed to "enter" a dir and gain possible access to sub-dirs
